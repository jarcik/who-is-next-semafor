# who-is-next-semafor
Arduino controlled led strip semafor for indicating who should sit on couch next

required library: FastLED

## What was the problem?
Our children were fighting over who should sit on the couch. I put timer on my phone for 15minutes but i needed my phone to use. So I needed some tool to indicate who's turn is now and for how long.

## How did who-is-next-semafor solves the problem?
Arduino controls led strip with 30 leds by color - like semafor. Every child has it's assigned color. Time is set for how long every color will be showing. After the time pass, semafor switches to another color in line.

## What will be next step to solve?
Changing color is great and everybody see it but there is a need for sound to know that the color has changed.
